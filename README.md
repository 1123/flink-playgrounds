## Playgrounds

This repository contains the configuration files for two Apache Flink playgrounds.

* The [Flink Cluster Playground](../master/flink-cluster-playground) consists of a Flink Session Cluster, a Kafka Cluster and a simple 
Flink Job. It is explained in detail as part of 
[Apache Flink's "Getting Started" guide](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/getting-started/docker-playgrounds/flink-cluster-playground.html). 

* The interactive SQL playground is still under development and will be added shortly.
